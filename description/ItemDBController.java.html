<p class="description">     This is the class for interacting with the items database via items.json.

    It starts out with the main function, which is actually not supposed to be used more than one time to initialize the database. So if I was testing a bunch and ended up accidentally purchasing all the items in the store, I could restore it to its previous state by wiping it then running this main function.

    Every function following this deals with the items.json file directly, and as such is labeled with the keyword "synchronized" which locks the method to be one thread at a time (per object, however there is only ever one ItemDBController object at a time so this doesn't matter). Thus all users get serial access to the database.

    This class has all the standard CRUD functions needed for a database, and they all return booleans to indicate success or failure of the operation.

    In addition there are a few miscellaneous functions as well such as getRandomItem() which is used to pick a random item for the homepage daily featured item and for the random item functionality. There is also getLastItem() which returns the last item found in the database.

    Then we have the organizeById() function, which is what we use to keep the items in order. We use a lambda function to sort each item based on its id then return the permuted arraylist.</p>
