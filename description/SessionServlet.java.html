<p class="description">     This servlet accepts a post or a get call (however the get call is the same as the post call). Once a call is received, the Servlet takes the following process:

    1. Set the sharesHeaderTages attribute. This contains all the links and scripts to things like Bootstrap and Jquery, so I wouldn't have to retype them each time, and makes refactoring a breeze. Only downside is that it looks a little ugly.

    2. Get the action parameter from the request.

    3. Get the identifier (session string) from the request.

    4. If either action or identifier are either null or blank, then assume this is the first time the user has accesses the we app. We assume this because anytime a request is made without either of those parameters, it is because the user is hitting the default url (and therefore does not have an identifier or action yet).

        a. Create a new session.

        b. Assign the attribute "identifier" with the new session identifier to the request.

        c. Send the user to the login page.

    5. If the action and identifier are both not null or empty, then this is a normal user doing some task with a session string.

        a. Validate the session. If valid...

            i. Set the identifer attribute with the session string.

            ii. Set the authorized attribute so the controller servlet will allow this user access.

            iii. Send this request to the controller servlet.

        b. If the session is invalid...

            i. Send this request to the error page.

            ii. Remove the invalid session from the list of sessions.

    Session validation is done by first verifying that the session array in our storage contains a session which has an identifier that matches the identifier the user passed in. Following that, we calculate the difference between the current time and the session's last active time and detect if the user has been active in the last 15 minutes. Following that we do a hard check on the session by determining if it has been over 12 hours since the session was created. If any of these check fail, the session is invalid and we forward the user to an error page.

    Note that the hard check does not care how active you are. This is just to determine that someone didn't sneak in at some point.</p>
