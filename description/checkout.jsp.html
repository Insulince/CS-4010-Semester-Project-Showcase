<p class="description">     This view shows the user a final list of the items and gathers information for payment and shipping.

    We display the items in a similar manner to how we did that in my-cart.jsp.

    If the user likes what he sees, he can proceed to the bottom where he can enter his information. I used a lot of ternary operators within EL tags to pre-populate the fields if the data was in the database.

    The only weird one is the credit card number field. This field should NEVER be displayed in case someone got a hold of your account. So if it is being prepopulated, we append it with 12 dots and then the last 4 digits. This makes for difficult form validation though, however it is handled in the javascript at the top.

    Just before the submit button is a checkbox for updating the users information with the information they entered on the checkout screen.

    Once the user hits the submit button, the order is placed and his cart is empty. We then go to the order-placed.jsp view.</p>
